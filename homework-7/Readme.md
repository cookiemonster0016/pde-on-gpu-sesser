Exercise 1:  See lecture7_ex1.ipynb
Value from Task 7
My diffusion solver reaches about 32 % of the GPU’s peak memory bandwidth, meaning it performs well but could, in theory, be up to ~3× faster if memory access were perfectly optimized.

Exercise 2:
The maximal error from the gpu and cpu calculation was 8.326672684688674e-17, which is machine precision
